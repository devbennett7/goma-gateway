  # Proxy Global HTTP Cors
  cors:
    # Global routes cors for all routes
    origins:
      - http://localhost:8080
      - https://example.com
    # Global routes cors headers for all routes
    headers:

      Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: 'true'
      Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000
  ##### Define routes
  routes:
    # Example of a route | 1
    - name: Public
    # host Domain/host based request routing
      host: ""
      path: /public
      ## Rewrite a request path
      # e.g rewrite: /store to /
      rewrite: /healthz
      destination:  https://example.com
      #DisableHeaderXForward Disable X-forwarded header.
      # [X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-For, Host, Scheme ]
      # It will not match the backend route, by default, it's disabled
      disableHeaderXForward: false
      # Internal health check
      healthCheck: '' #/internal/health/ready
      # Route Cors, global cors will be overridden by route
      cors:
        # Route Origins Cors, global cors will be overridden by route
        origins:
          - https://dev.example.com
          - http://localhost:3000
          - https://example.com
        # Route Cors headers, route will override global cors
        headers:
          Access-Control-Allow-Methods: 'GET'
          Access-Control-Allow-Headers: 'Origin, Authorization, Accept, Content-Type, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, X-Client-Id, X-Session-Id'
          Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: 'true'
          Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000
      #### Define route blocklist paths
      blocklist:
        - /swagger-ui/*
        - /v2/swagger-ui/*
        - /api-docs/*
        - /internal/*
        - /actuator/*
      ##### Define route middlewares from middlewares names
      ## The name must be unique
      ## List of middleware name
      middlewares:
        # path to protect
        - path: /user
          # Rules defines which specific middleware applies to a route path
          rules:
