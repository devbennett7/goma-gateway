### Access Policy Middleware
The Access Policy middleware controls route access by either allowing or denying requests based on defined rules.
It supports two actions: `ALLOW` and `DENY`.

### How It Works
1. **Define an action:** Specify whether the middleware should `ALLOW` or `DENY` access.

2. **Set sourceRanges:** Provide a list of IP addresses, IP ranges or a CIDR block to which the policy applies. 

    Requests originating from these sources will be evaluated according to the specified action.

#### Example Configuration
Hereâ€™s an example of an Access Policy middleware configuration in YAML:

```yaml
middlewares:
  - name: access-policy
    type: accessPolicy
    rule:
      action: DENY # Specify either DENY or ALLOW
      sourceRanges:
        - 192.168.1.1 # Single IP address
        - 10.42.1.1-10.42.1.100 # IP range
        - 10.42.1.1/16 # CIDR block
```
